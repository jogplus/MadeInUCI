Made In UCI allows for students to show off their projects. Projects can vary from a business idea to a volunteering event.

Our platform serves to showcase the projects that inspire entrepreneurship, creativity, and public outreach. Projects can vary from software, to a business idea, to an engineering project, to a volunteering event. Made In UCI helps facilitate collaboration and exposure for UCI students, allowing them to reach more people and take their ideas to the next level.

### How we built it
* We built the platform using Flask and SQLAlchemy to keep track of projects, users, and stars.
* The app is also deployed on Google Cloud Platform App Engine using a SQL database.
* With love.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Understanding the Flask framework and SQLAlchemy.
* General UI of the website since it looks and feels very modern.
* The ability to "star" projects
* Deploying the project to Google Cloud Platform
* We were also able to complete most of the features we had planned.

### What's next for Made In UCI
The Made In UCI website is the first phase of a larger “Made In UCI” initiative that hopes to help cultivate and show off the entrepreneurial spirit at UCI. We would like to expand the platform to have a more robust profile system, allowing users to search through the talent pool at UCI to build a team. Need an iOS developer? A graphic designer? A backend engineer? Made In UCI will help you form the perfect team.  

Additional future features: search by project/user, comment on projects, iFrames for previewing projects, show top projects of month/year/all time
