        state

             state between the request and callback.  The authorization
             server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back
             to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for preventing
             cross-site request forgery as described in Section 10.12.

        The client directs the resource owner to the constructed URI using an
        HTTP redirection response, or by other means available to it via the
        user-agent.

        For example, the client directs the user-agent to make the following
        HTTP request using TLS (with extra line breaks for display purposes
